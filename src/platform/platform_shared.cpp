// A few notes on this:
// 1) Some shortcuts may feel counter-intuitive. For example in a keyboard where pressing "shift+-" produces an
// underscore, "_" is still interpreted the same as "-". IOW, "shift+-" == "shift+_" != "_" (just like "u" is the same
// as "U").
// 2) QHotKey fails to register some of the shortcuts we accept here (e.g. "Media Play").
// 3) QKeySequence seems to have problems with AtlGr. QKeySequence("AltGr").toString() prints rubbish (that it does not
// interpret back to mean the same thing). Unfortunately it is not enough to specify "ú" when that's what the layout
// produces for AltGr+U. The Sequence "ú" is accepted and QHotKey registers it, but is gets triggered on "U" and not
// "AltGr+U".
// 4) There does not seem to be a way to specify numpad keys in QKeySequence (with or without numlock).
// 5) meta only seems to work with other modifiers (e.g. ctrl+meta+x works, but meta+x doesn't even though it is
// accepted with no warning)
